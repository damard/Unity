# Specifies any additional enviromnent variables that may be required by your
# RTI vendor. Please note that depending on the RTI vendor, setting the 
# environment variables in-process at runtime may not work as the RTI 
# libraries may cache or load environment variables direclty from the OS 
# rather than from the loaded process. 
# 
# In such cases (for example the DMSO and NG-Pro RTIs) it is recommended to
# specify all required environment variables at the OS level.
#
# To specify environment variables by using the 'hla13.env' key, add any number
# of key-value pairs as key=value delimited by commas. Optionally, multiple 
# variables may spawn multiple lines by adding ' \' at the end of a line, such 
# as:
#

# main executable. Alternativaly, some RTIs may load RID files via an 
# environment variable instead, please refer to the documentation provided
# by your RTI vendor for details.
